**VoTG** - Voice over Telegram

Leverages [VoWiFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_WLAN) to make cellular call and SMS accessible via Telegram - anywhere in the world on domestic terms, no GSM coverage needed - only Internet access.

Currently, it will be using slightly modified [StrongSwan](https://github.com/votg-project/strongswan) to connect to mobile operator's ePDG.
I did succesfully established tunnel using it with a ePDG server of MTS (Russia) back in Summer 2020.
